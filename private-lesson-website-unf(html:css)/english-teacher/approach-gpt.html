                    <p>Confidence without skill is meaningless. True success lies in mastering your craft, not just believing you can. Skill is earned through hard work, practice, and perseverance. Confidence may open doors, but it's your actual ability that keeps them open. <mark>Focus on building real, tangible skills; they provide the foundation for genuine confidence.</mark> Remember, in the end, it's your expertise and competence that truly matter and lead to lasting achievements.</p>

                    <p>"Lost in translation" refers to the meaning or nuances of a phrase, word, or concept being misinterpreted, misunderstood, or diminished when converted from one language to another. This often happens because languages have unique idioms, cultural references, and connotations that may not have direct equivalents in other languages. As a result, the original intent, humor, or subtlety can be altered or lost entirely. The expression highlights the challenges and limitations of translating text or speech accurately between different linguistic and cultural contexts.</p>

                    <p>Using American expressions and filler words like "like," "um," or "you know" as a non-American does not always make you sound more fluent or natural. These words are often used unconsciously by native speakers, and their use can be very nuanced. <mark>If used incorrectly or too frequently, they can make your speech sound forced or awkward instead of fluent.</mark> True fluency comes from understanding and using the language naturally, including its rhythm and context, rather than just adding fillers. <mark>It's better to focus on clear, confident communication rather than trying to mimic every casual speech pattern.</mark></p>
